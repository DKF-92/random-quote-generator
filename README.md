# Random Quote Generator

### This program will generate a random quote when the page is first loaded. After this time the user will be able to generate a new quote by clicking the 'new quote' button

### Motivation/Why did you build this project?

This project was built as part of the freecodecamp.org's front end development libraries course. This course is designed to introduce new coders to Javascript, JQuery, and react as well as to continue their education in HTML and CSS.

### What problems did you solve?

This project mainly served as a way to continue my education in front end development, and most helped me ingrain several concepts in JavaScript. 

As this project was originally written on CodePen.io I had to transfer the project to VSCode and push the updated project to Github, one problem encountered along the way was with the cors origin. git hub was unable to access the jquery library until changing the 'script' to "https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.3.1.min.js". The addition of 'https' fixed the security issue and allowed the page to be launched properly from github where as before the page would load without the javascript elements working.

### What makes your project stand out?

As this project was taken following the directions of freecodecamp.org it was difficult to make it stand out amongst the crowd. I believe that by also randomizing the background color once the new quote button is pressed is a more unique feature
